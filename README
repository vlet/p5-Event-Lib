Event-Lib version 1.04
=========================

This module is a Perl wrapper around libevent(3) as available from
<http://libevent.org>.  It allows to execute a function
whenever a given event on a filehandle happens, a timeout occurs or a signal is
received.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In case you have several libevents installed and you'd like to use
the one in /usr/local/(lib|include):

   perl Makefile.PL INC=-I/usr/local/include LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -levent"
   make
   make test
   make install

For debugging-support, do:

    perl Makefile.PL DEFINE=-DEVENT_LIB_DEBUG
    ...

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    + libevent(3) from <http://libevent.org>;
      it's advisable to always use the latest version but
      everything >= 0.9 should work
    + a C compiler
    + recommended for the test-suite: GTop as available from the CPAN;
      if you have it installed, the test-suite will run memory-leak 
      tests as well.

SOURCE

Normally you'd get the latest version of Event-Lib from CPAN. But if you want to 
try the cutting edge version (especially if you plan on sending patches), please 
consider using the svn version, which can be checked out via:

  svn co http://svn.perl.org/modules/Event-Lib/trunk/ Event-Lib
